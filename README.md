# Weather Dashboard

A responsive weather application built using **React**, **Bootstrap**, and the **OpenWeatherMap API**. This app allows users to search for current weather conditions in any city worldwide.

## Project Overview

The **Weather Dashboard** enables users to view real-time weather data based on their search query. The app displays key weather information such as temperature, humidity, wind speed, and more. It also features error handling for invalid city names and smooth API integration.

### Key Features

- **Real-Time Weather Data**: Retrieves and displays accurate weather data based on the user's search.
- **City Search**: Allows the user to enter the name of any city to view current weather information.
- **Mobile Responsive**: Optimized for all screen sizes, offering a smooth experience on both desktop and mobile devices.
- **Error Handling**: Handles errors like invalid city names and unavailable API.

## Tech Stack

- **React**: For creating a dynamic and interactive UI.
- **Bootstrap**: Ensures mobile-first, responsive design.
- **OpenWeatherMap API**: Provides the real-time weather data.
- **Axios**: Used to make HTTP requests to the weather API.
